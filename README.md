## Getting Started

Mana is a WIP cross platform 2D and 3D rendering engine written in C. Fast compile times, low boilerplate code, and minimal external dependencies are core principles.<br/>

### Setting Up a Project

Pull dependencies with git, CMake support to automatically do this will be added in the future. Build with CMake and you should be good to go. Tested with Clang 10.0.0 on Windows.<br/>

### Features

Manifold Dual Contouring<br/>
Collada parser<br/>
10-Bit rendering<br/>
Rigid body and particle physics<br/>
Noise generation<br/>
